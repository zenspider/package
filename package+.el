;;; Commentary:

;; Provides extensions to `package.el` for Emacs 24 and later.

;; Declares a manifest of packages that should be installed on this
;; system, installing any missing packages and removing any installed
;; packages that are not in the manifest.
;;
;; This makes it easy to keep a list of packages under version control
;; and replicated across all your environments, without having to have
;; all the packages themselves under version control.
;;
;; Example:
;;
;;    (package-initialize)
;;    (add-to-list 'package-archives
;;      '("melpa" . "http://melpa.milkbox.net/packages/") t)
;;    (unless (package-installed-p 'package+)
;;      (package-install 'package+))
;;
;;    (package-manifest 'ag
;;                      'expand-region
;;                      'magit
;;                      'melpa
;;                      'package+
;;                      'paredit
;;                      'ruby-mode
;;                      'ssh
;;                      'window-number)

;;; Note:

;; package-version-for, package-delete-by-name, package-maybe-install,
;; package-cleanup, package-deps-for, and package-transitive-closure
;; are all going to be submitted upstream to emacs. They're in here
;; and only defined if package-cleanup is not already defined. If my
;; contributions get accepted upstream, they'll be deleted here at
;; some point.
